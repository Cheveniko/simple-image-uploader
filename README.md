## Simple Image Uploader

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is an amazing ui library but doesn't have an image uploader component. So I created one!

It has image validation built in and customizable styles with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

The image is validated inside a shadcn Form using zod, react-drop-zone and react-hook-form.
